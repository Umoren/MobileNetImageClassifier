## Mobile Net Image Classifier

The MobileNet model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for efficient image classification tasks, particularly on mobile and embedded devices.

The primary purpose of the MobileNet model is to provide an efficient solution for image classification tasks while maintaining high accuracy. It can recognize and categorize objects within images, such as identifying animals, plants, vehicles, and other objects. MobileNet can be applied in various applications, including:

- Image recognition and tagging for photo organization
- Augmented reality (AR) apps that recognize and label real-world objects
- Object detection and tracking in video streams
- Real-time image classification on mobile devices

### Steps used in integrating the model

1. Load the model: This step typically involves fetching the model from a server or loading it from a pre-trained file.
2. Preprocess the input data: Before feeding data into the model, it's important to preprocess it according to the model's requirements. This may involve resizing images, normalizing data, or converting data into a format the model can understand.
3. Implement the prediction or inference functionality: Once the data is preprocessed, you can use the model to make predictions or inferences based on the input data. This process typically involves calling a specific function or method provided by the TensorFlow.js library to apply the model to your data.
4. Post-process the model output: After obtaining the model's predictions or inferences, you may need to process the results to make them more understandable or useful. This could involve converting the model's output into human-readable labels, extracting the most relevant results, or further processing the data to meet your needs.
