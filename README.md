## Mobile Net Image Classifier

The MobileNet model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for efficient image classification tasks, particularly on mobile and embedded devices.

The primary purpose of the MobileNet model is to provide an efficient solution for image classification tasks while maintaining high accuracy. It can recognize and categorize objects within images, such as identifying animals, plants, vehicles, and other objects. MobileNet can be applied in various applications, including:

- Image recognition and tagging for photo organization
- Augmented reality (AR) apps that recognize and label real-world objects
- Object detection and tracking in video streams
- Real-time image classification on mobile devices
